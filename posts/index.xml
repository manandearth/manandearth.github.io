      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to draw from references, but this year I&amp;rsquo;ve started drawing from imagination. I realised that there is so much recorded in my head, that I don&amp;rsquo;t need to look at in order to imagine completely. There is quite a way to go still, I mostly can&amp;rsquo;t say that I am happy with the drawings, but the issue isn&amp;rsquo;t proportions or correctness of details and shading, mostly the issue is that I don&amp;rsquo;t understand where those images came from, some of them are right down embarrasing, all of them are strange, more about that later, in this letter I will say goodbye to some drawings made with references, either photograps I took, or photographs in books.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;dropcap&#34;&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;s this the point where a socialist turned into an anarchist? Did this just happen? I never gave it thought really, I guess I thought it is just utopian, like all its critics do, as well as thinking it is probably not going to work, which is besides the point, as no other system prove to work, certainly not the current one.&#xA;I&#39;ll start at that moment, or a couple of moments before, I was running up a hill, a hill that I run almost daily. It is not an easy climb, but I am used to it, and my mind alway wonders and I am at the top before I know it.&#xA;I was thinking about something, not sure what, and the voice in my head was judging and calling one idea a &#39;mature&#39; idea, and how for that reason this should be the accepted idea, being close to &#39;objective&#39; and &#39;correct&#39; and &#39;true&#39;, only at that moment it broke and I realised there is no objective and whatever idea will depend on perspective, on a point of view, and on context. So what we call &#39;mature&#39; represents such point of view, and some interest in specific outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is not going to be easy. The subject is a series of underexposed photos on the top of Simancon. Going up there this time, we were overtook by a few runners, mostly solitary, but there was at least one couple as well. Every time we are there I think that perhaps if I lived there this would have been my daily run. The village below lays at about 900m above see level and the peak is at 1,549m, so it&amp;rsquo;s fairly a serious daily jog. I wonder how fast it could be done if one get&amp;rsquo;s into the rhythm of doing this daily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Scratchy cut film</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Part of the magic of taking photos in black and white is due to the fact the photographer doesn&amp;rsquo;t see in black and white. Even if one removes all the errors in exposure and the possible chemical issues, which for me are a norm, we humans don&amp;rsquo;t see the world in monochrome and the results are always surprising. This and the fact that what your eyes differentiate so easily due to color separation is just mud for the black and white film makes this medium challenging and strangely rewarding.&#xA;One other interesting fact, is that photographs, perhaps like music, take a time to create a space in your mind and your heart. what seems terrible at first, might look really great in a short while, and better in longer while. I told this to my dad the other day, on the phone, and he affirmed in an excited voice ( relatively excited.. ) that yeah, he always noticed that with his own portraits, that where he thought he looked not too good, he now looks really cool.&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;center-image&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;../images/issue_001/vejer_from_cross_color.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Vejer from cross&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Vejer from cross&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;My current adventures in film I started with a baby Graflex from the 1930s. I bought it online, and spent some time fixing and cleaning, and trying to figure a way to cut film for the strange 2 1/4&amp;quot; x 3 1/4&amp;quot; format. plus film holder for this unusual format for developing the film in a standard developing tank. I realised quite early that nature and chemistry will shine more than my expertise in this game, I am more of a tinkerer than a real technician, and I enjoy tinkering a lot.&#xA;My best photograph in my eyes by far, so far&amp;hellip; is one I took using a multi film sheet holder, it is the Grafmatic, it is ingenius, and allows firing 6 sheets, but&amp;hellip; being almost a century old, mine does tend to get stuck. In this particular case the subject being a far away windmill at night, the meter demanded 8 seconds exposure, and the graflex capable of 1/10 of a second ( early days, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think of just openning the shutter and use a lens cap to control the time ) meant I had to fire it 80 times, but after about 10 exposures I realise that every time that I wind the shutter between shots, I expose the film again, since I wasn&amp;rsquo;t replacing the film cover..  well at that point I decided to stop, and also at that moment the film holder got stuck. Later at home in a dark bag I managed to rescue that sheet, not without seriously scratching it.&#xA;Art.&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;center-image&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;../images/issue_001/vejer_night_color.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Vejer Night&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;    &lt;figcaption&gt;Scratchy night&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
