      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to draw from references, but this year I&amp;rsquo;ve started drawing from imagination. I realised that there is so much recorded in my head, that I don&amp;rsquo;t need to look at in order to imagine completely. There is quite a way to go still, I mostly can&amp;rsquo;t say that I am happy with the drawings, but the issue isn&amp;rsquo;t proportions or correctness of details and shading, mostly the issue is that I don&amp;rsquo;t understand where those images came from, some of them are right down embarrasing, all of them are strange, more about that later, in this letter I will say goodbye to some drawings made with references, either photograps I took, or photographs in books.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
